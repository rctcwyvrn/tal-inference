- make unifier struct, have it handle the state
- add subtyping checks for ptr types
  - check that we pass in something larger (? we can solve for the polymorphic rho with the ptr we're passing in?)
  - i get the feeling that rho types are not very useful for code types, because theres no return value lmao
    - its useful for our internal checking for load/store, but not for code types

extra
- properly split out the inference types and the final types
- make a system for outputting the gammas and typevar instantiations
